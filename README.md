DayZ Community Offline Mode is a small sideproject to offer all of you,  
who did not have the chance to play on a stress test server for long alreay, the chance to enjoy the 0.63 stress test update.  
There is not much to do ingame, but you can explore the map, fight some infected, test your hardware limits by spawning alot of them
and most important of all CLIMB LADDERS!!! (Jokes aside, ladders have become really nice, definitely try them out)  

This is UNOFFICIAL, so don't blame the DayZ development team if this is not working at all for you!

Note to other developers:  
Yes the code might be messy, yes there are things that do not look like they should work or do anything!  
DayZ is not opened for modding or scripting, so this is pretty much a hacky solution to everything.  
If you want to improve something, go ahead and create a pullrequest ;)

# Installation:
Download [this](https://github.com/Arkensor/DayZCommunityOfflineMode/releases/download/v1.9/DayZ.Community.OfflineMode.zip) zip archive.  
Make sure you are on the "stress test" beta branch on steam. See [this link](https://dayz.com/blog/0-63-stress-tests) for details on how to switch on it!  

Place the ```Missions``` folder inside your DayZ game directory (```For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ```).  
Even though this is not directly bannable by Battleye, just to make sure: Rename your Battleye folder to Battleye.disabled, and rename the DayZ_BE.exe to DayZ_BE.exe.disabled.

Now you now start the script ```DayZ/Missions/DayZCommunityOfflineMode.ChernarusPlus/DayZCommunityOfflineMode.bat``` to start the game. You will be loaded directly into the offline mode.  
Or add the following start parameter to your game: ```-mission=.\Missions\DayZCommunityOfflineMode.ChernarusPlus```

To unstinstall this mod, simple delete all downloaded files, and rename your .disabled folders back to their original name.   
You might delete your whole ```Missions``` folder and validate your game files via steam to get the original DayZ files back.

# Logfiles:

Locations are stored inside the script.log for now.

You find your logfiles here: ```Press WINDOWS + R  -> Type in %localappdata%/DayZ -> Hit enter```. 

# Future:
